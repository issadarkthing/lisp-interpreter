# lisp-interpreter
Simple lisp interpreter. One of the goal of this lisp dialect is to improve
the readability of common lisp. It tries to reduce the number of parenthesis
and be consistent with the syntax of the language. So far, everything is a 
function. This is general construct of the language `(name args args)`, the
first symbol inside parenthesis is the function name, and the subsequent is
the function arguments.
